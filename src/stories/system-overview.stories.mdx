<h1>System Overview</h1>

<p>Gemini is a platform agnostic Javascript styling solution for use with Opensesame products.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">How to think about Gemini</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">Styles &lt;- Themes &lt;- Tokens</h3>

<p>
  Gemini is a styling solution that provides CSS stylesheets from Gemini styles, which are based on a Gemini theme, which is based on Gemini
  tokens.
</p>

<p>
  Gemini is made up of system parts that interact with each other to assemble the building blocks of tokens, themes, and styles. When using
  Gemini, we think about what we want to accomplish, the styling of our application, and let the system parts worry about the rest. Your
  application uses styles, which are created from themes, which are created from tokens. You can intervene at any point in the chain with
  your own custom styles, custom themes, and token sets. This overview describes the parts of the system that let you do that.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">System Parts</h2>

<p>The Gemini Design System includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Pattern library</strong> - The design side of Gemini exists as a library in Figma.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Theming engine</strong> - The heart of the system, the theming engine applies themes and styles to a Gemini powered application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Component library</strong> - Component styles for use with any platform and atomic components for use with Angular.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gemini CSS</strong> - All the Gemini styles as CSS for use with CSS framework based applications
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gemini media server</strong> - Cloud based storage for Gemini assets, such as icons, images, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gemini image system</strong> - An image optimization system using Fastly Image Optimizer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subheading">Pattern Library</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">Gemini's design side</h3>

<p>
  <strong>The designs for Gemini styles and components.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  All designs begin in Figma. The Gemini pattern library is a collection of components and styles from which Gemini styles and components
  are built. The pattern library is a single source of truth for the UX patterns and designes used by the Gemini theming engine and
  component library. Gemini styles and components must look and behave in accorance with the designs in the pattern library.
</p>

<p>
  The pattern library is themable. The designs in the pattern library use the same design tokens as the theming engine. If you build an
  application styled with Gemini, you are using these tokens, too. Each designer, when creating a design in the pattern library, uses a
  token set. Often, this is the default Opensesame brand token set, but it can be changed. A designer is free to create a custom token set
  for a unique look and feel without worrying about the most basic patterns that all designs must implement. These basic patterns include
  things like standard border radius, how things should hover, and all the basic design agreements that form a consistent user experience.
  Visual elements, like color, typography, sizes of this or that, etc. can be changed.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Theming Engine</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">The heart of the system.</h3>

<p>
  <strong>The theming engine does the work of connecting design and development.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The Gemini theming engine is a collection of Javascript functions that perform the logical tasks of styling your application. It all
  starts with a theme, a machine readable JSON object derived from pattern library tokens and exposed to internal styles and components.
  Styles are derived from a theme. A JSS styles object uses theme values and CSS properties in the same way you would use CSS, only a styles
  object is JSON. The theming engine transpiles a styles object into a CSS stylesheet and injects it into your application's document HEAD.
</p>

<p>
  The theming engine exports all the internal functions for use when working with themes. Everything is customizable, and you can use any
  part, or all of the theming engine functionality in your development.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Component library</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">More than just Angular components.</h3>

<p>
  <strong>A collection of component styles and Angular components.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The Gemini component library is a collection of Angular components like any other component library. Gemini components, however, export as
  their default the component styles objects. The component styles objects can be used, along with the Gemini theming engine, on any
  platform, even Angular. If using Angular, the NG component modules are pre-compiled, Ivy compatible components for use with Angular 11.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Gemini CSS</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">No framework? No problem.</h3>

<p>
  <strong>All the Gemini styles in a CSS stylesheet.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Whether you use HTML/CSS, LAMP stack, or legacy SASS applications, Gemini CSS can work like any CSS framework or library. Use Gemini CSS
  in a website in the same way you would use something like Bootstrap, Tailwind, and the like. By default, Gemini CSS provides all the
  Gemini styles, however, using the theming engine, you can programmatically create your own, targeted stylesheet for your situation.
  Because it only provides Gemini styles, it is not a complete solution, and Opensesame recommends using Gemini CSS with Bootstrap
  scaffolding classes.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Gemini Media Server</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">All the stuff you don't want in your bundle.</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Static assets, such as images and icons, that don't belong in the NPM package.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Gemini provides access to a number of static assets, such as icons, brand images, etc., however, none of these things should be in the NPM
  package. Through Gemini components and theming engine functions, access to assets are abstracted. You can access the Gemini media server
  through Gemini components or the theming engine, or access it directly. The media server has brand assets and all the icons as SVGs.
</p>

<p>
  The media server is also used by the Gemini image optimization system. If images are stored on the media server, they can be optimized by
  Gemini components and theming engine functions.
</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Gemini Image System</h2>

<h3 class="subheading">An image optimization system.</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Images optimized for quick delivery, fast rendering, and resposiveness.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The image optimization system is an implementation of the Fastly Image Optimizer. Images on the Gemini media server can be optimized using
  Gemini components and functions. Gemini also has functionality to optimize images from any server, you are not restricted to using the
  Gemini media server.
