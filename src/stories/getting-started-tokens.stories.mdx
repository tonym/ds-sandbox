<h1>Tokens</h1>
<p>
  Gemini uses design tokens when creating themes. Tokens are provided by design, uploaded from Figma, and converted into style stuff used by
  themes and components.
</p>
<h2>What are tokens?</h2>
<p>
  Tokens are very small definitions of things designers need to create a design. A color value, for instance, is a token. So are border
  radii, spacing units, fonts, and all the small things needed by both design and atoms. Tokens replace hard-coded values in designs and
  themes with logical and descriptive names.
</p>
<p>
  Gemini themes and components both use tokens. When you use a value from a Gemini theme, you are selecting the same token your designer
  used. Figma and Gemini keep these tokens in sync automatically. If you're token based design changes, so do the tokens.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
  Figma and Gemini communicate with each other via a Figma plugin. The plugin syncs changes to the tokens to the Gemini Github repository
  where a Github action detects the change and converts the tokens to Javascript and creates Typescript types.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Tokens are synced to Github in a single file. Each token file contains many token sets. Sets are tokens with different values. Imagine a
  token called PrimaryColor. Set A might use blue for PrimaryColor, and set B might use red. To the designer or developer, using the token
  PrimaryColor instead of the color value means you don't have to change your code when you switch sets.
</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means Simon and CourseCloud can both use the same tokens, they just use different sets.</p>
<p>
  Gemini uses these tokens in its themes. Colors are mapped to tokens that were defined in Figma. This is also true of typography, spacing,
  borders, etc.
</p>
<h2>Using tokens</h2>
<p>
  By default, Gemini uses the OpenSesame brand token set. If you are using this set, you don't have to do anything. It's there
  automatically. If, however, your designer has told you to use a different set, you have to provide that set.
</p>
<p>To provide a token set, first import the token set provider</p>

Path import

```javascript
import provideTokens from '@opensesame/gemini/styles/provideTokens';
```

Named import (use with Angular)

```javascript
import { provideTokens } from '@opensesame/gemini';
```

<p>
  Then provide the tokens in your code. Remember, you only have to do this if you are not using the default token set. The default token set
  is provided automatically.
</p>

```javascript
provideTokens('simon');
```

<p>
  When using token sets, it's a good practice to provide tokens first, then provide your theme, then everything else. Here is what your
  application's entry point might look like with a token set.
</p>

```javascript
import { cssBaseline, provideTokens, provideTheme } from '@opensesame/gemini';

provideTokens('simon');
provideTheme();
cssBaseline();

export const MyApp = () => {
  ...
}
```
