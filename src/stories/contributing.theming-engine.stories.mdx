<h1>Developing for the Gemini Theming Engine</h1>

<p>
  The Gemini Theming Engine is a collection of small javascript functions. They are either creators, providers or helpers. Separating
  responsiblity allows for small, simple functions that each do only one thing.
</p>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

- Functions do one thing and one thing only.
- Provision and creation are independant of each other.

<h2>Creators and providers</h2>

<p>
  Creating and providing are two different things, and are intentionally kept separate. For example, a stylesheet has a stylesheet creator
  and a stylesheet provider. The creator transforms JSS to CSS and returns a StyleSheet object. The provider injects it into the DOM. This
  separation of concerns keeps the functions simple and easily testable.
</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Development is simple, build small Javascript funcitons that each do one thing and one thing only.</p>

- Avoid conditional blocks. If you have a conditional, you have 2 functions.
- Ternary assignments are fine.
- User data always wins. Spread user provided arguments over core defaults.

<h2>Pull requests</h2>

<p>Follow the same PR pattern as for any other engineering ticket. There is no checklist for theminig engine PRs.</p>
