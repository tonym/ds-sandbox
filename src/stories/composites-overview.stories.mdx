<h1>Overview - what are composites?</h1>

<p>
  A composite is a component built from atoms. Atoms, or atomic components, are the simple building blocks of complex components
  (composites) and are often data-aware, meaning they are sometimes connected to a data source such as a JSON response from a REST API, a
  local store, or user input. Where atoms are the "dumb" components, such as checkboxes, buttons, chips, cards, etc., composites are complex
  assemblies such as application wrappers, profile editors, file upload modals, etc. Composites are characterized by their handling of data
  and business logic, user flows, forms, or navigation. Often, the content or user actions visible in a composite are generated dynamically,
  such as the navigation in a sidebar, the articles in a news feed, or the inputs of a form.

<p>
  Composites are not distributed like atoms, as part of the Gemini bundle. Instead, they are presented as "recipes." Recipes are code
  snippets and notes, along with static examples showing how you might use atoms to construct a given composite. They can be a great
  starting point for building your composite and connecting your data in ways determined by your business logic and data shape. They are
  also great ways to experiment if you want to see how to use Gemini atoms in your project or story.
