<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
  Theming engine functions are the core functionality of creating and providing a theme to the host application, and some utilities that
  help manage styles and themes.
</p>

<p>
  Style specific functions are grouped into Creators, Providers, and utilities.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Creators</strong> create aspects of themes, styles and stylesheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Providers</strong> make the aspects of themes, styles and stylesheets available to the host application.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Utilities</strong> are functions that manage the aspects of themes, styles and stylesheets in the host application.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>The theme is a collection of "style stuff" that style creators, and sometimes devlopers, use to create styles and, eventually, CSS.</p>

<h3>ThemeOptions</h3>
<p>Optional theme content. ThemeOptions are provided by the host application developer when setting up a custom theme.</p>

<h3>Styles</h3>
<p>A JSS style object. All Gemini components have, and export, styles. It's from styles that stylesheets are created.</p>

<h3>Stylesheet</h3>
<p>
  The CSS created from Styles, and injected into the DOM. (Notice the spelling. A JSS stylesheet is a StyleSheet, but a Gemini stylesheet is
  a Stylesheet. The distinction is the Typescript type. They are two different interfaces.)
</p>

<h3>StyleSheetFactoryOptions</h3>
<p>The JSS options to use when creating a Stylesheet.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>The classes object that associates your Styles object keys with the CSS classes in the resulting Stylesheet.</p>
